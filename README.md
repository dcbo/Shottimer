# espresso shot timer 

## features
 - 7-Seg style graphic output on I2C-OLED display
 - temperature display 
 - control of baristlight during shot (digital or PWM)
 
by  Dario Carluccio (user dondario of http://www.kaffee-netz.de) <shottimer.at.carluccio.de>

based on idea and hardware from 
 - David Ki√üling (user mactree of http://www.kaffee-netz.de )
 

## todo
- [ ] change switch input to valve and measure preinfusion seperate
- [ ] design new display output if inactive
- [ ] store values in eeprom
  - no. of shots longer than MIN_SHOT_TIME - UNSIGNED LONG
  - seconds of pump operation - UNSIGNED LONG
- [x] add barista light control 

## changelog
- v2.1 rev 002 - baristalight added with many configuration options
  (pin configuration, polatity high/low active, pwm speed on/off, timeout)                
- v2.1 rev 001 - Complete code rewritten, baristalight still missing
